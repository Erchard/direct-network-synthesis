## 2026-09-05: Repository Scaffold

Created the initial reproducible research scaffold for Direct Network Synthesis.

Decisions:

- Use a Python `src/` package layout.
- Track strict train/validation/test separation from the beginning.
- Start with linear ridge, RBF kernel ridge, and deterministic ReLU-feature baselines.
- Add DNS 0.4 as an SVD-based direct feature synthesis prototype.
- Add DNS 0.5 Kernel Compiler as an initial weighted-kernel construction module.
- Avoid claims of novelty until evidence and related-work analysis justify stronger language.

Next experiments:

- Run the starter synthetic nonlinear regression benchmark.
- Add at least one real tabular regression dataset with fixed splits.
- Compare DNS 0.4 and DNS 0.5 against the minimum baseline set across all splits.
